## Instructions for lab material 
We do not have a lab0 this time, numbers start at 1, see end of this document for numbering as well as the MASTER file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qOUR2p-4vPB2GH7InxDQ44AO8VG1Y_lsLjDwWZC-Fxk/edit#gid=1666709440

\<public\> :  Harvard-IACS/2019-CS109B/content/
  
### 1) Use the Lab Template: 
\<private\>/labs/cs109b_lab_template.ipynb

### 1a) Write the index.md file (example for X is 2)
Title: Lab 2<br>
Date: 2019-01-27<br>
Slug: lab2<br>
Author: Me<br>
\# Lab 2<br>

### 2) Lab drafts are created in \<private\>/labs_playground/labX
**\<private\>/labs_playground/** is free form, no structure, only people who work on the labs look at this. A good practice is not to change each other's files but to copy, then change, and put your name, e.g., lab3_splines_PP.ipynb.

### 3) When you are finished, copy the final version of labX in folder \<private\>/labs/labX
#### Follow the naming conventions
cs109b_labX_intro_to_python.ipynb<br>
cs109b_labX_instructions.txt<br>

#### Adhere to the stucture
**\<private\>/labs/** all presentation pdf, ppt, notebooks, go here, in main folder<br>
**\<private\>/labs/data/** all data go in here, for CNNs images go in here (they are data)<br>
**\<private\>/labs/figs/** figures that are not data go in here, e.g. figures contained in the notebooks<br>

### 4) Copy the \<private\>/labs/labX as a folder over to the public repo as-is:
**\<private\>/labs/labX** is the one that gets moved “as is” to the public repo. **Do not change once in public**. If you want to change, change in private and copy again whole directory labX/.<br>
So, \<private\>/labs/labX needs to be copied in \<public\>/labs/labX

### You are Done!
